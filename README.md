# UTA by New Genesis
## (The project will be updated constantly)

## Intro
New Genesis UTA is a groundbreaking music platform that merges the power of blockchain technology with the passion of music enthusiasts. Our platform offers a unique blend of music streaming, social media interaction, and gamified rewards, providing an immersive experience for both users and artists.

Key features include the 'Listen to Earn' system, where users are rewarded with UTA tokens for every minute of music they enjoy, and the NFT Companion system, where users can acquire and level up digital companions that offer enhanced rewards and benefits.

With a dynamic ranking system, exclusive benefits, and integration into the Metaverse, New Genesis UTA is revolutionizing the way we experience and interact with music.

## How It Works
New Genesis UTA operates on a simple yet powerful principle: reward users for their engagement and contributions to the platform. Here's how it all comes together:

### SoundBites
At the core of UTA app there is the concept of SoundBites. SoundBites are short audiovisual clips that encapsulate musical performances, compositions, and expressions. Ranging from original compositions to covers, remixes, and collaborations, SoundBites capture the diversity and richness of musical expression across genres and styles.

### Listen to Earn
Users simply watch their favorite SoundBites on the platform and earn UTA tokens for every minute of music streamed. The longer you watch, the more tokens you earn. It's that easy!

### NFT Companions
Users can acquire and level up digital companions through NFTs. These companions offer unique attributes and benefits, such as increased rewards and exclusive access to content, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Items
Users can buy items (NFTs) from the marketplace to enhance their companions attributes and by consequence increase their rewards. Items also serve as normal NFTs in the artistic aspect and can be sold or traded in the Peer 2 peer section or third party platforms such as Opensea or Mintable...

### Companion Points (CP)
Performing daily tasks within the app, such as liking, sharing, and interacting with content, earns users Contribution Points (CP). These points unlock exclusive benefits and the opportunity to receive a gifted companion, further incentivizing engagement.

### Dynamic Ranking System
Users are ranked within the platform based on their activity level, engagement score, and contributions. Climbing the ranks unlocks prestigious rewards and privileges, encouraging users to strive for higher levels of engagement.

### Integration with the Metaverse
New Genesis UTA is not just a music platformâ€”it's a gateway to the Metaverse. Users can attend live concerts, interact with artists, and explore virtual worlds, all while earning rewards and leveling up their companions.

### Continuous Innovation
We're constantly innovating and improving the platform to provide the best possible experience for our users. From new features to enhanced rewards, we're committed to shaping the future of music discovery and engagement.
